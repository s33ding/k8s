- It's An **HTTP** API.
- It  allows users,  cluster components, and external components to **communicate**.
- Allows you to **query and manipulate the state of Kubernetes objects (such as Pods)**.


### REST
- The k8s API is a **RESTful** or **REST** API 
- REST - REpresentational State Transfer, an architectural style by Roy Fielding.
- You can **retrieve a representation of the state of a resource or object**.
- You can **send a representation of the state to create/update objects**.
- **Can use formats like YAML or JSON**, but the objects are ultimately considered REST or RESTful objects.

### PERSISTENCE
- Permanent storage of data.
- Interact w/ the API via  HTTP verbs like GET, UPDATE, and DELETE.
- We can use formats like YAML and JSON interchangeably to visualize the states of objects using API calls.
