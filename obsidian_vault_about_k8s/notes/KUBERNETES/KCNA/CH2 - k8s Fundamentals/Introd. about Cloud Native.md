### Kubernetes and  Cloud Native:

- Kubernetes is a cloud-native platform  for containerized applications.
- This enables you to manage containerized applications w/ cloud native features.
- It works in a public or private cloud.
--- 

### It is a whole new way of thinking about infrastructure

New Tools:
-  ...
New Models:
- "___ as a service" models change how we design applications.
- New ways of design applications as the result of these technologies.

New normal:
- Cloud adoption is accelerating!

---
### Cloud Native Means:
Leveraging the cloud for:

- Resiliency:
	- Using the cloud to protect against downtime or loss of service in the event of failures.
- Manageability:
	- to ensure that applications and  infrastructure are easy to manage.
	
- Observability:
	- to provide visibility into the status and performance of applications and infrastructure.


Cloud Native applications and processes are built from the ground and processes are built from the ground up to take full advantage of the cloud.
