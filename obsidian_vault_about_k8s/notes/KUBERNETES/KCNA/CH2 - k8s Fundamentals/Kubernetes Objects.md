- Kubernetes objects - A piece o data that represents the state of the cluster.

- When you create or modify an object, Kubernetes works constantly to implement the desired state expressed in the object data.

obs: You can look at the data within  a Pod object to gain information about the state of those containers, or even to know what is going on the cluster.

You can define your own custom resource types using a CustomResourceDefinition.
